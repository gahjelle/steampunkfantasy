Not Yet dead: after this model in the unit base is killed, this model is not yet dead after all. This model becomes a new unit base and becomes an {\it awakened war hero} with the same equipment as this model and orders available as the unit base this model is attached to . Awakened War Hero does not retain any of the abilities from the unit base or the model, and has a seperate model and unit base entry. See War Hero. In the case this model is not the last model to be eliminated, it may be the case that you get an extra unit base in the hex. If this causes overcrowding (more than 2 bases in a hex), the war hero may spawn in one of the neighborhing hex which is furthest from an enemy unit



This only replaces models of existing units. For damage and orders available see the unit which you replace models from.

If there are multiple hexes which you can move the target to move it towards you, you may choose where to move the enemy. If this movement forces the target to move into a hex occupied by you, carry out an assault. If this movement turns the hex into an overcrowded hex, or an impassable hex, do not move target unit but turn it into a shaken unit instead. If the enemy is flying, move the target to the ground
