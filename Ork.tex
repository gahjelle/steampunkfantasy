Not Yet dead: after this model in the unit base is killed, this model is not yet dead after all. This model becomes a new unit base and becomes an {\it awakened war hero} with the same equipment as this model and orders available as the unit base this model is attached to . Awakened War Hero does not retain any of the abilities from the unit base or the model, and has a seperate model and unit base entry. See War Hero. In the case this model is not the last model to be eliminated, it may be the case that you get an extra unit base in the hex. If this causes overcrowding (more than 2 bases in a hex), the war hero may spawn in one of the neighborhing hex which is furthest from an enemy unit



This only replaces models of existing units. For damage and orders available see the unit which you replace models from.

May have up to 4 ammo stored. Enhanced Accurazy: unit gain +1 to hit (but only when firing this weapon)\\ If you have 4 ammo stored, you may spend all 4 ammo to use the 'heavy shot' seting when firing a shot. If you do gain range: 4, AP:3 and damage:d6-1\\ps! It is nor recommended combining this with other ranged weapons as a ork pistol. However if you do, track ammo and loading actions etc. for the other gun and this weapon seperately

Unit base gains damage resistance 1\\ Multipe shields: Damage resistance is NOT cumulative, but the assault deflection is. Thus, you may have two shield on same model if you wish. However the model is equiped with nothing but shields it gains -1/-1/-1/-1 penalty on assault values. (thus 2 shields is only sensable you have 4 arms)
