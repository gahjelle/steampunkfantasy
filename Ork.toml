Awakened War Hero does not retain any of the abilities from the unit base or the model, and has a seperate model and unit base entry. See War Hero. In the case this model is not the last model to be eliminated, it may be the case that you get an extra unit base in the hex. If this causes overcrowding (more than 2 bases in a hex), the war hero may spawn in one of the neighborhing hex which is furthest from an enemy unit"
