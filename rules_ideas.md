Setup units according to this order:


- Setup All HUGE units.

- Setup ANY scout (any unit with scout in unit type) you wish to deploy

- Setup all units (except hidden and remaining scouts) within line of sigtht of an enemy scout 

- Setup all other units (except hidden and remaining scouts) not in line of sight of an enemy scout.

- Setup all remaining scouts.

- Setup one hidden token for each hidden unit not already deployed. You do not have to tell what is behind each hidden token, but you must
keep track for your self to know which is which. 



Roll a die for each step. However wins has an setup advantage, and starts seting up second. The one with disadvantage set up one unit first, then players alternate setting up two units until the step is finished. One step must be finished for both sides before advancing to next step. Thus if a player runs out of units within one step, the other sets up all units in that steps before preciding with next step.



-Roll 1 dN-die per unit base with either biological or biological crew description (without immunity from poison or immunity from poison cloud), if you get above (n+poison_resistance) of the unit, the unit base is pinned. 

If placing a poison cloud in a hex with a poison cloud already,
increase  the density of the most dense cloud one step, and set the level equal to the highest level: Ie Poison Cloud[8](4+) + Poison Cloud[4](5+) = Poison Cloud[8](3+)
